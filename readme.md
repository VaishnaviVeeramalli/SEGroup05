# UNTMerch

UNTMerch is a client-server application with a separated frontend and backend.

## Frontend

The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is responsible for rendering the UI and handling user interactions.

### Technologies
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS

## Backend (Node.js)

The backend is built using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment that allows running JavaScript on the server-side. It handles the application logic, data storage, and communication with the frontend.

### Technologies
- Node.js
- MongoDB (Database)

## Communication

The frontend and backend communicate with each other using HTTP protocols (e.g., REST APIs). The frontend sends requests to the backend to fetch or modify data, and the backend responds with the appropriate data or status.

## Authentication

The application includes an admin login functionality with the following credentials:

- Email: admin@gmail.com
- Password: Admin@123

## Deployment

The frontend (React) and backend (Node.js) components are deployed separately. The frontend is typically served as a static website, while the backend runs on a server and handles the API requests.
